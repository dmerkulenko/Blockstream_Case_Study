## Overview and Origin

Blockstream is a blockchain tech company that builds professional enterprise – class products and services that strengthen the Bitcoin infrastructure by making the process of mining more efficient and reliable. (1)

Blockstream was founded in 2014 by Adam Back and other group of developers consisted of Eric Svenson, Pieter Wuille, and others. Its headquarters are located in Victoria, BC. (1) Adam Back (CEO of Blockstream) plays a big role in cryptocurrency world and the biggest in creating the Blockstream company. He was previously known for his development of email system called Hashcash, which features not only anti-spam algorithms but also proof-of-work ones that are mostly used as function to mine bitcoin. (2) He later noticed that Bitcoin ecosystem was not prepared for enterprise usage and was lacking commercial foundation. Then as a way of extending bitcoin, Back came to an idea of creating the company, Blockstream. (3)

Back in 2014 Blockstream was firstly funded with seed capital in the amount of $21 million, which was extended in 2016 into Series A round funding in the amount of $55 million. Later in 2017 already existing partnership with Digital Garage was expanded to “accelerate cryptocurrency and blockchain developments in Japan”, which was supported by an investment that totalled the company’s funding to more than $80 million. The most recent Series B round funding has raised $210 million, which values Blockstream at $3.2 billion. (1)

## Business Activities

One of the biggest problems in crypto world is that digital assets are illiquid. Blockstream has recognized a problem of Bitcoin’s performance being “hampered by technical and market dynamics” and that it requires a great amount of time and effort to transfer/exchange them. To solve this problem Blockstream launched Liquid sidechain that would allow bitcoin transactions to be removed from the main chain, where they have tendency to pile up. (Blockstream.com –more concise link required) Moreover, Blockstream also launched AQUA, which is a mobile wallet that simplifies the process of sending and receiving digital assets. AQUA is also distinguished by its confidentiality and the speed of transaction process.  AQUA wallet is suitable for casual users and is ideal for crypto newbies, who prefer everything being convenient and simple without any highly advanced features that may stand in the way. (4)  Overall, Blockstream’s audience is for people who position themselves in a Bitcoin community, “core technologies and smart-contract programmers” and for businesses that want to implement blockchain into their operations.

Blockstream’s competitive advantage is those key features that they set up in their products, which stand out by its security, fast speed, and its ease of use. 

## Landscape

Blockstream is in the blockchain and cryptocurrency domain. 

Major Trends over the past 5 years:

The first trend of the Blockchain domain is the rising popularity of NFT, which stands for nonfungible tokens that can take a form of being a code, picture or even music. These digital assets take presence on a blockchain and are valuable due to their uniqueness. This has become one of the ways to raise superior profits. Especially artists who can sell their products of art for millions of dollars. (6)

Another trend is using blockchain “as-a-service model of distribution”. This includes cloud-based networks, IoT and artificial intelligence. Blockchain can now be used to help companies to create “smart contracts” that could, for instance, check whether all the conditions have been met and automatically generate a contract in case of success. (6)

Stable coins can also be considered as a major trend as they bring a solution for the problem of cryptocurrencies being highly volatile. Their value is being tied up to such assets as gold, silver and monetary currencies, which makes their value to remain relatively stable. (7)
